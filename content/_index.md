# Hello, I’m Hazhar.

This is my home on the web, where I pretend to know what I’m doing.

I was going to put something professional here, but then I realized:
the internet already has **too many competent people**.  
So instead, you’ll find only the finest quality nonsense:

- Half-baked ideas, served lukewarm.
- Projects that start with a bang and end with me googling *"why does my code segfault when I breathe"*.
- Mostly harmless, occasionally confusing.
- Profoundly unhelpful reflections on life, such as:
  - If the universe is infinite, then somewhere out there is a version of me who actually finished writing this list.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by.
Stay as long as you like. Just don’t ask me what the point of it all is—
